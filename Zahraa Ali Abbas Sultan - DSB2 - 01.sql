-- The Basics
-- ## Simple SELECTs
-- 1) Query all the data in the `pets` table.  
-- SELECT *
-- FROM pets
-- 2) Query only the first 5 rows of the `pets` table.
-- SELECT *
-- FROM pets
-- LIMIT 5

-- 3) Query only the names and ages of the pets in the `pets` table.
SELECT name,age
FROM pets;

-- 4) Query the pets in the `pets` table, sorted youngest to oldest.
select *
from pets
ORDER by age ASC;

-- 5) Query the pets in the `pets` table alphabetically.
SELECT*
from pets
order by name ASC;

-- 6) Query all the male pets in the `pets` table.
SELECT*
from pets
where sex='M';

-- 7) Query all the cats in the `pets` table.
select*
from pets
where species='cat';

-- 8) Query all the pets in the `pets` table that are at least 5 years old.
select*
from pets
where age >= 5
order by age ASC;

-- 9) Query all the male dogs in the `pets` table. Do not include the sex or species column, since you already know them.
select name,age
from pets
where sex='M' AND lower(species)="dog";

-- 10) Get all the names of the dogs in the `pets` table that are younger than 5 years old.
select name ,age
from pets 
where age<5 and lower(species)="dog";

-- 11) Query all the pets in the `pets` table that are either male dogs or female cats.
select *
from pets 
where lower(sex)='m' and lower(species)='dog' 
or lower(sex)='f' and lower(species)='cat';

-- 12) Query the five oldest pets in the `pets` table.
select*
from pets
order by age DESC
limit 5;

-- 13) Get the names and ages of all the female cats in the `pets` table sorted by age, descending.
select name,age
from pets
where lower(sex)='f' and lower(species)='cat'
order by age DESC;

-- 14) Get all pets from `pets` whose names start with P.
select *
from pets 
where lower(name)like'p%';

-- 15) Select all employees from `employees_null` where the salary is missing.
SELECT*
FROM "employees_null"
where salary is NULL;

-- 16) Select all employees from `employees_null` where the salary is below $35,000 or missing.
select*
from employees_null
where salary <35000 or salary is null;

-- 17) Select all employees from `employees_null` where the job title is missing. What do you see?
select*
from employees_null 
where job is NULL;
-- I see that Id=101 , and the name is unknown , there is no nformation about the employee with job is null"

-- 18) Who is the newest employee in `employees`? The most senior?
select *
from employees
order by startdate DESC;
-- newest employee is Roger Conner , startdate is 2019-05-24
select *
from employees
order by startdate aSC;
-- most senior is Mary Nash , startdate is 1990-02-16

-- 19) Select all employees from `employees` named Thomas.
select *
from employees
where lower(firstname)="thomas";

-- 20) Select all employees from `employees` named Thomas or Shannon.
select *
from employees
where lower(firstname) in ("thomas","shannon");

-- 21) Select all employees from `employees` named Robert, Lisa, or any name that begins with a J. In addition, only show employees who are _not_ in sales. This will be a little bit of a longer query.
--     * _Hint:_ There will only be 6 rows in the result.
select *
from employees
where (lower(firstname) in ('robert','lisa') OR lower(firstname) like 'J%') 
And lower(job) <> 'sales';

-- ## Column Operations
-- 22) Query the top 5 rows of the `employees` table to get a glimpse of these new data.
select*
from employees
limit 5;

-- 23) Query the `employees` table, but convert their salaries to Euros. 
--     * _Hint:_ 1 Euro = 1.1 USD.
--     * _Hint2:_ If you think the output is ugly, try out the `ROUND()` function.
select *,
Round((salary/1.1),2)
from employees;

-- 24) Repeat the previous problem, but rename the column `salary_eu`.
select *,
Round((salary/1.1),2) as salary_eu
from employees;

-- 25) Query the `employees` table, but combine the `firstname` and `lastname` columns to be "Firstname, Lastname" format. Call this column `fullname`. For example, the first row should contain `Thompson, Christine` as `fullname`. Also, display the rounded `salary_eu` instead of `salary`.
--     * _Hint:_ The string concatenation operator is `||`
SELECT id,firstname || ', ' || lastname AS fullname,job ,
       ROUND(salary / 1.1, 2) AS salary_eu, startdate
FROM employees;

-- 26) Query the `employees` table, but replace `startdate` with `startyear` using the `SUBSTR()` function. Also include `fullname` and `salary_eu`.
select  id,firstname || ', ' || lastname as fullname, job, 
round(salary/1.1,2) as salary_eu,
substr(startdate,1,4) as startyear
from employees;

-- 27) Repeat the above problem, but instead of using `SUBSTR()`, use `STRFTIME()`.
select  id,firstname || ', ' || lastname as fullname, job, 
round(salary/1.1,2) as salary_eu,
strftime('%Y',startdate) as startyear
from employees;

-- 28) Query the `employees` table, replacing `firstname`/`lastname` with `fullname` and `startdate` with `startyear`. Print out the salary in USD again, except format it with a dollar sign, comma separators, and no decimal. For example, the first row should read `$123,696`. This column should still be named `salary`.
--     * _Hint:_ Check out SQLite's `printf` function.
--     * _Hint2:_ The format string you'll need is `$%,.2d`. You should read more about such formatting strings as they're useful in Python, too!
select id,firstname||','||lastname as fullname,job,
strftime('%Y',startdate) as startyear,
printf('$%,.2d',salary) as salary
from employees;

-- **Note:** For the next few problems, you'll probably want to use `CASE`/`WHEN` statements.
-- 
-- 29) Last year, only salespeople were eligible for bonuses. Create a column `bonus` that is "Yes" if you're eligible for a bonus, otherwise "No".
select *,
CASE
  when lower(job)='sales' then 'Yes'
  else 'No'
  end as bonus
  from employees;

-- 30) This year, only sales people with a salary of $100,000 or higher are eligible for bonuses. Create a `bonus` column like in the last problem for salespeople with salaries at least $100,000.
select*,case 
when lower(job)='sales' and salary >100000 then 'Yes'
else 'No'
end as Bonus 
from employees;

-- 31) Next year, the bonus structure will be a little more complicated. You'll create a `target_comp` column which represents an employee's target total compensation after their bonus. Here is the company's bonus structure:
-- 
-- * Salespeople who make more than $100,000 will be eligible for a 10% bonus.
-- * Salespeople who make less than $100,000 will be eligible for a 5% bonus.
-- * Administrators will also be eligible for a 5% bonus.
-- * Anyone who does not meet any of the above descriptions is not eligible for a bonus.
-- 
-- Create this `target_comp` column, making sure to format _both_ the `salary` and `target_comp` columns nicely (ie, with dollar signs and comma separators).
select id,firstname||','||lastname as fullname,job, printf('$%,.2d',salary) as salary,startdate,
printf('$%,.2d',CASE
when (lower(job)='sales' and salary>100000) then salary*1.10
when (lower(job)='sales' and salary<=100000) then salary*1.05
when lower(job)='administrators' then salary*1.05
else salary
end) as target_comp
from employees;
